# WinForms Rich Text Editor API â€“ How to Process Word Documents in Code

The [WinForms Rich Text Editor Control](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/controls/winforms/rich_editor/) allows you to deliver Microsoft Word-inspired functionality with ease. It includes comprehensive text formatting options, supports mail merge, and ships with a rich collection of end-user options you can use to create high-impact document processing solutions.

This example demonstrates how to use the Rich Text Editor to execute the following actions:

- Create, load, merge, split, save, and print documents
- Save a document in PDF and HTML formats
- Convert an HTML file to PDF and DOCX formats
- Format a document
- Manage document elements (paragraphs, lists, tables, shapes, pictures, headers, footers, notes, bookmarks, hyperlinks, and comments)
- Insert and modify fields
- Configure page layout settings
- Specify the built-in and custom document properties
- Protect and unprotect a document
- Create character, paragraph, and linked styles
- Import formatted text to a document
- Add checkbox form fields to a document
- Embed arbitrary XML data (custom XML parts) in a document

The applicationâ€™s form contains the list of supported operations and editors that display the code and the result of these operations. A user can select an operation to view its code and result.
